# Project Setup Instructions

This document outlines the steps to set up both the frontend and backend of the project.

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system.

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

cd frontend


2. Install the required Node.js packages using npm:


npm install


3. Start the development server for the frontend:

npm run start


## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system.

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

cd backend


2. Install the required Node.js packages using npm:

npm install



3. Run the development server for the backend:

npm run dev




This command will start the backend server, and you should see logs indicating that it's running.

Once you have completed these steps, both the frontend and backend of your project should be up and running, allowing you to begin development.

Happy coding!
